Now here comes the supposed fun part. Let's translate a file!

0. **For Linux/macOS users only**:
    1. **Install [Wine](https://wiki.winehq.org/Download) and [winetricks](https://github.com/Winetricks/winetricks)**.
        * Both should be in every major Linux distro's repository.
    2. Run `winetricks dotnet452` in the terminal and follow the on-screen instructions.
        * This will install the Microsoft .NET 4.5.2 and 4.0 runtimes.
        * If you're running Wine for the first time, you'll be asked to install `wine-mono` and `wine-gecko`. Install them.
        * You'll probably get a ton of warnings about 64-bit support. Ignore them
        * The installer will show sizes as 0MB. This is normal.
        * At some point you'll be asked to reboot your computer. It doesn't matter what you choose. You don't have to reboot.
1. **Download [Kuriimu](https://github.com/IcySon55/Kuriimu/releases/latest)** and extract the .rar archive somewhere on your computer.
2. Run `Kuriimu.exe`.
3. Open one of your MSBT files and create a backup when prompted.
4. Try translating the strings to your language without changing the tags (nulls and weird characters).
5. Save the file when finished.

Proceed to [Testing your translation](https://github.com/bandithedoge/switch-pl/wiki/4.-Testing-your-translation).
