# Please DO NOT follow this guide at the moment. It's work-in-progress, messy and inconsistent.

So you want to translate the system menu to your language. Thank you for making the Switch scene more accessible to newcomers!

# What you need

* A PC running Windows, macOS or Linux.
  * Make sure that the explorer displays [file name extensions](https://i.imgur.com/XIgRpnX.png) on Windows.
* Very good knowledge of English and the language you're translating to.
  * Mistakes in your translation can really confuse the user. It's a good idea to have someone else check your translation for potential errors.
* A lot of time.
  * The Switch system menu is huge and there's a lot of files. It took us over 3 months to complete the first full release.
* Basic CLI (command line interface) knowledge.
* A Nintendo Switch running custom firmware (duh)
  * Your console must be on the firmware version you want to make the translation for. The process will (hopefully) never change for newer firmwares.
  * Your CFW must support LayeredFS. Currently all three major CFWs support it by default.
