Read this page if you're having problems with your translation.

* > My console doesn't boot with the translated file or crashes when accessing the translated part.
  * You either compressed the wrong file or it's corrupted.

* > I translated all the strings but I don't see the translation.
  * Double check the folder structure and file names. Also check if you're using your CFW with LayeredFS support.

* > Some text appears correctly but some is blank
  * You either left the strings blank or the file is missing some strings. A common reason for this is using a system menu dump from a different firmware than you're using.

* > hactool gives an error and doesn't extract the NCA.
  * [Scenario 1](https://i.imgur.com/OO421sE.png): You're missing keys. A common reason for this is using keys from an earlier firmware version than the titles you dumped.
  * [Scenario 2](https://i.imgur.com/X40L4uV.png): You probably tried to extract an NSP. Re-read [Extracting the dumps](https://github.com/bandithedoge/switch-pl/wiki/Extracting-the-dumps).
