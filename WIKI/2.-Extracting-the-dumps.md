System menu dumps are pretty useless by themselves. We need a way to extract them.

1. **Install [hactool](https://github.com/SciresM/hactool)**.
    * **Windows**: Download the .zip archive from the latest [release](https://github.com/SciresM/hactool/releases/latest) and extract it somewhere on your computer.
    * **Arch Linux**: Install [hactool-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hactool-git) from the AUR.
    * **openSUSE**: Install the [hactool](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/hardware/hactool) package.
    * **Other systems**: [Compile from source](https://github.com/SciresM/hactool#building) or run the Windows executable under Wine (not recommended, use only if you can't compile hactool).
2. Open a command line wherever you put your NSP files.
    * Make sure you have your hactool directory in your PATH or put the hactool binary in the same directory as the NSP files.
3. Run `hactool -k <KEYS> --intype=pfs0 --pfs0dir="nca" -x <NSP>`.
    * Replace `<KEYS>` with the path to your `prod.keys` file.
    * Replace `<NSP>` with the path to the NSP file you want to extract.
4. A directory named `nca` will be created. Navigate to it and you'll find 2 NCA files. Delete the smaller one (4 KB) and rename the larger one to the TitleID of the NSP file you've just extracted.
    * Repeat steps 3 and 4 for every NSP file.
5. Run `hactool -k <KEYS> --romfsdir=<TITLEID> <NCA>`.
    * Replace `<KEYS>` with the path to your `prod.keys` file.
    * Replace `<NCA>` with the path to the NCA file you want to extract.
    * Replace `<TITLEID>` with the TitleID of the NCA file.
6. A directory named after the TitleID will be created. Navigate to it, go to `/message/EUen` and copy all files to another directory.
    * Repeat steps 5 and 6 for every NCA file.
    * **NOTE**: There will be multiple instances of the same files such as `common.msbt.szs`. They should be the same across all titles. See [progress.md](https://github.com/bandithedoge/switch-pl/blob/master/progress.md) for more information.
7. **Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**.
    * All major Linux distributions should have Python in their official repositories as `python` or `python3`. Install it with your distro's default package manager.
    * **Make sure that Python is in your PATH enviroment variable.**
8. **Download [libyaz0](https://github.com/aboood40091/libyaz0)**.
    * **If you have git installed**: Open a command lime, navigate to wherever you want libyaz0 installed and run `git clone https://github.com/aboood40091/libyaz0.git`.
    * **If you don't have git installed**: Go to https://github.com/aboood40091/libyaz0, click the green *Clone or download* button and *Download ZIP*. Extract the .zip archive somewhere on your computer.
9. Run `python <LIBYAZ0> <SZS>`
    * Replace `<LIBYAZ0>` with the path to the *main.py* file from the libyaz0 repository.
    * Replace `<SZS>` with the path to your SZS file.
    * If `python` doesn't work and you're sure it's installed correctly, try `python3` or `py`.
10. You'll get a file with the `.msbt.msbt` extension. **Do not change the extension**! Move the file to another directory.
11. Repeat steps 9 and 10 for every SZS file.
    * **NOTE**: `Cruiser.msbt` and `MiiEditN.msbt` do not require extraction. Move them next to the rest of extracted MSBT files and **do not change the extension**!
